This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Then an Express server was added in the `server` directory. The server is proxied via the `proxy` key in `package.json`.

Create a `.env` file for environment variables in your server.

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

### `npm run server`

Server will run on [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).

The React application will run on port 3000 and the server port 3001.
